# 🍔 Mc'Download™ Backstage Ordering Program

> *"Welcome to Mc'Download, where the burgers are virtual, the analysis is fake, and the waiting is eternal."*

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **gloriously dysfunctional** Python ordering system that simulates the worst parts of modern digital UX — including fake AI, slow loading bars, privacy warnings, and forced upsells.

It is not meant to work well.  
It is meant to work *authentically badly*.

## 🧠 Features (or Crimes Against UX)

| Feature            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧾 Menu Items       | Delightfully weird item names (Cool'Caal Cola, Nuggents, Push Cola...)       |
| 🌀 Order Loop       | Infinite order input until you type `'done'`                                |
| 💸 GST Calculation  | Applies 15% GST (New Zealand standard) with precision formatting             |
| 🧠 Fake AI Loading  | Two different loading sequences with totally useless progress bars           |
| 🧃 Recommendation Engine | Uses fake “2008 AI” to force a drink upsell — politely, then sarcastically |
| 📄 Receipt Output   | Includes randomly generated Order ID and current timestamp                   |
| 🔒 Double Privacy Reminders | Reassures you twice that we will “only” use your data “properly”       |
| 🤡 Personalized Judgement | Based on how much you spent — from “tiny meal” to “big stomach king”     |

📋 Sample Output Snippet
vbnet
Schedule: 60% - Reticulating fried fish splines...
Schedule: 70% - Verifying soda carbonation level...
>>> Based on your craving pattern, we *strongly* recommend a Cool'Caal Cola. Only $2.50!
